## General Information <a name="general-information"></a>
This repository contains code written in the GNU Prolog programming language, aimed at enhancing our skills in logic programming through a descriptive programming approach. In this project, we are tasked with implementing concepts such as recursion, lists, cuts, failures, and loops, which we have learned in class, through individual study, and in previous practical sessions using Prolog. The project centers around a game named "Global Conquest: Battle for Supremacy," a popular board game playable by 2 to 4 players. The game's objective is to emerge as the sole victor, conquering the entire world. Strive to be that winner!

## Game Concepts <a name="game-concepts"></a>
- A strategic board game themed around world warfare, playable by 2 to 4 players.
- The primary objective of this game is for players to attempt to conquer all territories owned by their opponents.
- A player is declared defeated if they no longer possess any territories, and victorious if they manage to acquire all territories on the board.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to perform installations, including:
- `GNU Prolog` which is a free Prolog compiler with constraint solving over finite domains (FD) integrated. It adheres closely to the ISO standard for Prolog, which is a key feature for ensuring compatibility and standardization in Prolog programming.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository :
```shell
git clone git@github.com:GAIB21/tugas-besar-if2121-logika-komputasional-2023-keosenjoyer.git
```

2. Find the path:
```shell
cd  src
```

3. Then, you are ready to go and use the command which you like to play the game. Start the game using this command `startGame.`
